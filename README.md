# VERDICT AI

**VERDICT AI** is a decision-grade AI system for e-commerce and online businesses that converts raw business data into clear, profit-focused decisions. Instead of dashboards or vague insights, it issues concrete recommendations such as pricing changes, ad scaling, or inventory actions—each backed by financial logic and enforced guardrails.

---

## Purpose
Most businesses collect data but struggle to decide what action to take next. **VERDICT AI** eliminates guesswork by calculating real profit metrics and translating them into accountable business verdicts that protect against loss and support sustainable growth.

---

## What VERDICT AI Does
The system ingests structured business data (sales, costs, customers, advertising) and computes core profit metrics such as margins, customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and price sensitivity. Using strict financial rules, it evaluates which actions are allowed, simulates their profit impact, and outputs the top decisions ranked by expected profit impact.
